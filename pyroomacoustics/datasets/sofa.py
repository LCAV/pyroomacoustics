Pyroomacoustics contains a small database of SOFA files that have been tested
and can be used for simultions.
The database can be loaded using the function
:py:class:`~pyroomacoustics.datasets.sofa.SOFADatabase`.

.. code-block:: python

    # load and display the list of available SOFA files and their content
    from pyroomacoustics.datasets import SOFADatabase

    db = SOFADatabase()
    db.list()

The database contains the following files.

- Three files from the `DIRPAT database
  <https://phaidra.kug.ac.at/detail/o:68229#?page=1&pagesize=10&collection=o:67857>`_
  collected by Manuel Brandner, Matthias Frank, and Daniel Rudrich University
  of Music and Performing Arts, Graz.

  - ``AKG_c480_c414_CUBE.sofa`` containing the directive responses of a
    microphone with 4 different patterns.
  - ``EM32_Directivity.sofa`` that contains the directional response of the
    `Eigenmike em32 <https://eigenmike.com/eigenmike-em32>`_ microphone array.
  - ``LSPs_HATS_GuitarCabinets_Akustikmessplatz.sofa`` that contains 12 source
    directivities. This file is dynamically downloaded upon its first use.
  - The files are public domain
    (`CC0 <https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/>`_),
    but if you use them in your research, please cite the following
    `paper <https://aes2.org/publications/elibrary-page/?id=19538>`_.
