class IterativeWiener(object):
    r"""
    A class for performing **single channel** noise reduction in the frequency
    domain with a Wiener filter that is iteratively computed. This
    implementation is based off of the approach presented in:

        J. Lim and A. Oppenheim, *All-Pole Modeling of Degraded Speech,*
        IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 26.3
        (1978): 197-210.

    For each frame, a Wiener filter of the following form is computed and
    applied to the noisy samples in the frequency domain:

    .. math::

        H(\\omega) = \dfrac{P_S(\\omega)}{P_S(\\omega) + \\sigma_d^2},


    where :math:`P_S(\omega)` is the speech power spectral density and
    :math:`\sigma_d^2` is the noise variance.

    The following assumptions are made in order to arrive at the above filter
    as the optimal solution:

    - The noisy samples :math:`y[n]` can be written as:

      .. math::

        y[n] = s[n] + d[n],

      where :math:`s[n]` is the desired signal and :math:`d[n]` is the
      background noise.
    - The signal and noise are uncorrelated.
    - The noise is white Gaussian, i.e. it has a flat power spectrum with
      amplitude :math:`\sigma_d^2`.

    Under these assumptions, the above Wiener filter minimizes the mean-square
    error between the true samples :math:`s[0:N-1]` and the estimated one
    :math:`\hat{s[0:N-1]}` by filtering :math:`y[0:N-1]` with the above filter
    (with :math:`N` being the frame length).

    The fundamental part of this approach is correctly (or as well as possible)
    estimating the speech power spectral density :math:`P_S(\omega)` and the
    noise variance :math:`\sigma_d^2`. For this, we need a **voice activity
    detector** in order to determine when we have incoming speech. In this
    implementation, we use a simple energy threshold on the input frame, which
    is set with the `thresh` input parameter.

    **When no speech is identified**, the input frame is used to update the
    noise variance :math:`\sigma_d^2`. We could simply set :math:`\sigma_d^2`
    to the energy of the input frame. However, we employ a simple IIR filter in
    order to avoid abrupt changes in the noise level (thus adding an assumption
    of stationary):

    .. math::

        \sigma_d^2[k] = \\alpha \cdot \sigma_d^2[k-1] + (1-\\alpha) \cdot \sigma_y^2,

    where :math:`\\alpha` is the smoothing parameter and :math:`\sigma_y^2` is
    the energy of the input frame. A high value of :math:`\\alpha` will update
    the noise level very slowly, while a low value will make it very sensitive
    to changes at the input. The value for :math:`\\alpha` can be set with the
    `alpha` parameter.

    **When speech is identified in the input frame**, an iterative procedure is
    employed in order to estimate :math:`P_S(\omega)` (and therefore the Wiener
    filter :math:`H` as well). This procedure consists of computing :math:`p`
    `linear predictive coding (LPC) coefficients <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_predictive_coding>`_
    of the input frame. The number of LPC coefficients is set with the
    parameter `lpc_order`. These LPC coefficients form an all-pole filter that
    models the vocal tract as described in the above paper (Eq. 1). With these
    coefficients, we can then obtain an estimate of the speech power spectral
    density (Eq. 41b) and thus the corresponding Wiener filter (Eq. 41a). This
    Wiener filter is used to denoise the input frame. Moreover, with this
    denoised frame, we can compute new LPC coefficients and therefore a new
    Wiener filter. The idea behind this approach is that by iteratively
    computing the LPC coefficients as such, we can obtain a better estimate of
    the speech power spectral density. The number of iterations can be set with
    the `iterations` parameter.

    Below is an example of how to use this class to emulate a streaming/online
    input. A full example can be found
    `here <https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics/blob/master/examples/noise_reduction_wiener_filtering.py>`_.

    There also exists a "one-shot" function.

        signal frame.
    alpha : int
        Smoothing factor within [0,1] for updating noise level. Closer to `1`
        gives more weight to the previous noise level, while closer to `0`
        gives more weight to the current frame's level. Closer to `0` can track
        more rapid changes in the noise level. However, if a speech frame is
        incorrectly identified as noise, you can end up removing desired
        speech.
    thresh : float
        Threshold to distinguish between (signal+noise) and (noise) frames. A
        high value will classify more frames as noise but might remove desired
        signal!
