class SpectralSub(object):
    r"""
    Here we have a class for performing **single channel** noise reduction via
    spectral subtraction. The instantaneous signal energy and noise floor is
    estimated at each time instance (for each frequency bin) and this is used
    to compute a gain filter with which to perform spectral subtraction.

    For a given frame `n`, the gain for frequency bin `k` is given by:

    .. math::

        G[k, n] = \max \\left \{ \\left ( \dfrac{P[k, n]-\\beta P_N[k, n]}{P[k, n]} \\right )^\\alpha, G_{min} \\right \},

    where :math:`G_{min} = 10^{-(db\_reduc/20)}` and :math:`db\_reduc` is the
    maximum reduction (in dB) that we are willing to perform for each bin (a
    high value can actually be detrimental, see below). The instantaneous
    energy :math:`P[k,n]` is computed by simply squaring the frequency
    amplitude at the bin `k`. The time-frequency decomposition of the input
    signal is typically done with the STFT and overlapping frames. The noise
    estimate :math:`P_N[k, n]` for frequency bin `k` is given by looking back a
    certain number of frames :math:`L` and selecting the bin with the lowest
    energy:

    .. math::

        P_N[k, n] = \min_{[n-L, n]} P[k, n]

    This approach works best when the SNR is positive and the noise is rather
    stationary. An alternative approach for the noise estimate (also in the
    case of stationary noise) would be to apply a lowpass filter for each
    frequency bin.

    With a large suppression, i.e. large values for :math:`db\_reduc`, we can
    observe a typical artefact of such spectral subtraction approaches, namely
    "musical noise".
    `Here <https://www.vocal.com/noise-reduction/musical-noise/>`_ is nice
    article about noise reduction and musical noise.

    Adjusting the constants :math:`\\beta` and :math:`\\alpha` also presents a
    trade-off between suppression and undesirable artefacts, i.e. more
    noticeable musical noise.

    Below is an example of how to use this class to emulate a streaming/online
    input. A full example can be found
    `here <https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics/blob/master/examples/noise_reduction_spectral_subtraction.py>`__.
