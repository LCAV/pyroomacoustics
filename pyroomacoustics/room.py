Room
====

The three main classes are :py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.room.Room`,
:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.soundsource.SoundSource`, and
:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.beamforming.MicrophoneArray`. On a high level, a
simulation scenario is created by first defining a room to which a few sound
sources and a microphone array are attached. The actual audio is attached to
the source as raw audio samples. The image source method (ISM) is then used to
find all image sources up to a maximum specified order and room impulse
responses (RIR) are generated from their positions. The microphone signals are
then created by convolving the audio samples associated to sources with the
appropriate RIR. Since the simulation is done on discrete-time signals, a
sampling frequency is specified for the room and the sources it contains.
Microphones can optionally operate at a different sampling frequency; a rate
conversion is done in this case.

Simulating a Shoebox Room
-------------------------

We will first walk through the steps to simulate a shoebox-shaped room in 3D.


Create the room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So-called shoebox rooms are pallelepipedic rooms with 4 or 6 walls (in 2D and 3D,
respectiely), all at right angles. They are defined by a single vector that contains
the lengths of the walls. They have the advantage of being simple to define and very
efficient to simulate. A ``9m x 7.5m x 3.5m`` room is simply defined like this

.. code-block:: python

    import pyroomacoustics as pra
    room = pra.ShoeBox([9, 7.5, 3.5], fs=16000, absorption=0.35, max_order=17)

The second argument is the sampling frequency at which the RIR will be
generated. Note that the default value of ``fs`` is 8 kHz. The third argument
is the absorption of the walls, namely reflections are multiplied by ``(1 -
absorption)`` for every wall they hit. The fourth argument is the maximum
number of reflections allowed in the ISM.

The relationship between ``absorption``/``max_order`` and `reverberation time
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation>`_ (the T60 or RT60 in the
acoustics literature) is not straightforward. `Sabine's formula
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation#Sabine_equation>`_ can be used to
some extent to set these parameters.


Add sources and microphones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sources are fairly straighforward to create. They take their location as single
mandatory argument, and a signal and start time as optional arguments.  Here we
create a source located at ``[2.5, 3.73, 1.76]`` within the room, that will utter
the content of the wav file ``speech.wav`` starting at ``1.3 s`` into the simulation.

.. code-block:: python

    # import a mono wavfile as the source signal
    # the sampling frequency should match that of the room
    from scipy.io import wavfile
    _, audio = wavfile.read('speech.wav')

    my_source = pra.SoundSource([2.5, 3.73, 1.76], signal=audio, delay=1.3)

    # place the source in the room
    room.add_source(my_source)

The locations of the microphones in the array should be provided in a numpy
``nd-array`` of size ``(ndim, nmics)``, that is each column contains the
coordinates of one microphone. This array is used to construct a
:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.beamforming.MicrophoneArray` object, together with the
sampling frequency for the microphone. Note that it can be different from that
of the room, in which case resampling will occur. Here, we create an array
with two microphones placed at ``[6.3, 4.87, 1.2]`` and ``[6.3, 4.93, 1.2]``.

.. code-block:: python

    # define the location of the array
    import numpy as np
    R = np.c_[
        [6.3, 4.87, 1.2],  # mic 1
        [6.3, 4.93, 1.2],  # mic 2
        ]

    # the fs of the microphones is the same as the room
    mic_array = pra.MicrophoneArray(R, room.fs)

    # finally place the array in the room
    room.add_microphone_array(mic_array)

A number of routines exist to create regular array geometries in 2D.

- :py:func:`pyroomacoustics.beamforming.linear_2D_array`
- :py:func:`pyroomacoustics.beamforming.circular_2D_array`
- :py:func:`pyroomacoustics.beamforming.square_2D_array`
- :py:func:`pyroomacoustics.beamforming.poisson_2D_array`
- :py:func:`pyroomacoustics.beamforming.spiral_2D_array`


Create the Room Impulse Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, the RIRs are simply created by invoking the ISM via
:py:func:`pyroomacoustics.room.Room.image_source_model`. This function will
generate all the images sources up to the order required and use them to
generate the RIRs, which will be stored in the ``rir`` attribute of ``room``.
The attribute ``rir`` is a list of lists so that the outer list is on microphones
and the inner list over sources.

.. code-block:: python

    room.compute_rir()

    # plot the RIR between mic 1 and source 0
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(room.rir[1][0])
    plt.show()


Simulate sound propagation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By calling :py:func:`pyroomacoustics.room.Room.simulate`, a convolution of the
signal of each source (if not ``None``) will be performed with the
corresponding room impulse response. The output from the convolutions will be summed up
at the microphones. The result is stored in the ``signals`` attribute of ``room.mic_array``
with each row corresponding to one microphone.

.. code-block:: python

    room.simulate()

    # plot signal at microphone 1
    plt.plot(room.mic_array.signals[1,:])

Controlling the signal-to-noise ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is in general necessary to scale the signals from different sources to
obtain a specific signal-to-noise or signal-to-interference ratio (SNR and SIR,
respectively). This can be done by passing some options to the :py:func:`simulate()`
function. Because the relative amplitude of signals will change at different microphones
due to propagation, it is necessary to choose a reference microphone. By default, this
will be the first microphone in the array (index 0). The simplest choice is to choose
the variance of the noise \\(\\sigma_n^2\\) to achieve a desired SNR with respect
to the cumulative signal from all sources. Assuming that the signals from all sources
are scaled to have the same amplitude (e.g., unit amplitude) at the reference microphone,
the SNR is defined as

.. math::

    \mathsf{SNR} = 10 \log_{10} \frac{K}{\sigma_n^2}

where \\(K\\) is the number of sources. For example, an SNR of 10 decibels (dB)
can be obtained using the following code

.. code-block:: python

    room.simulate(reference_mic=0, snr=10)

Sometimes, more challenging normalizations are necessary. In that case,
a custom callback function can be provided to simulate. For example,
we can imagine a scenario where we have ``n_src`` out of which ``n_tgt``
are the targets, the rest being interferers. We will assume all
targets have unit variance, and all interferers have equal
variance \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) (at the reference microphone). In
addition, there is uncorrelated noise \\(\\sigma_n^2\\) at
every microphones. We will define SNR and SIR with respect
to a single target source:

.. math::

    \mathsf{SNR} & = 10 \log_{10} \frac{1}{\sigma_n^2}

    \mathsf{SIR} & = 10 \log_{10} \frac{1}{(\mathsf{n_{src}} - \mathsf{n_{tgt}}) \sigma_i^2}

The callback function ``callback_mix`` takes as argument an nd-array
``premix_signals`` of shape ``(n_src, n_mics, n_samples)`` that contains the
microphone signals prior to mixing. The signal propagated from the ``k``-th
source to the ``m``-th microphone is contained in ``premix_signals[k,m,:]``. It
is possible to provide optional arguments to the callback via
``callback_mix_kwargs`` optional argument. Here is the code
implementing the example described.

.. code-block:: python

    # the extra arguments are given in a dictionary
    callback_mix_kwargs = {
            'snr' : 30,  # SNR target is 30 decibels
            'sir' : 10,  # SIR target is 10 decibels
            'n_src' : 6,
            'n_tgt' : 2,
            'ref_mic' : 0,
            }

    def callback_mix(premix, snr=0, sir=0, ref_mic=0, n_src=None, n_tgt=None):

        # first normalize all separate recording to have unit power at microphone one
        p_mic_ref = np.std(premix[:,ref_mic,:], axis=1)
        premix /= p_mic_ref[:,None,None]

        # now compute the power of interference signal needed to achieve desired SIR
        sigma_i = np.sqrt(10 ** (- sir / 10) / (n_src - n_tgt))
        premix[n_tgt:n_src,:,:] *= sigma_i

        # compute noise variance
        sigma_n = np.sqrt(10 ** (- snr / 10))

        # Mix down the recorded signals
        mix = np.sum(premix[:n_src,:], axis=0) + sigma_n * np.random.randn(*premix.shape[1:])

        return mix

    # Run the simulation
    room.simulate(
            callback_mix=callback_mix,
            callback_mix_kwargs=callback_mix_kwargs,
            )
    mics_signals = room.mic_array.signals

In addition, it is desirable in some cases to obtain the microphone signals
with individual sources, prior to mixing. For example, this is useful to
evaluate the output from blind source separation algorithms. In this case, the
``return_premix`` argument should be set to ``True``

.. code-block:: python

    premix = room.simulate(return_premix=True)

        Simulates the microphone signal at every microphone in the array

        Parameters
        ----------
        reference_mic: int, optional
            The index of the reference microphone to use for SNR computations.
            The default reference microphone is the first one (index 0)
        snr: float, optional
            The target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decibels at the reference microphone.
            When this option is used the argument
            :py:attr:`pyroomacoustics.room.Room.sigma2_awgn` is ignored. The variance of
            every source at the reference microphone is normalized to one and
            the variance of the noise \\(\\sigma_n^2\\) is chosen

            .. math::

                \mathsf{SNR} = 10 \log_{10} \frac{ K }{ \sigma_n^2 }

            The value of :py:attr:`pyroomacoustics.room.Room.sigma2_awgn` is also set
            to \\(\\sigma_n^2\\) automatically

        callback_mix: func, optional
            A function that will perform the mix, it takes as first argument
            an array of shape ``(n_sources, n_mics, n_samples)`` that contains
            the source signals convolved with the room impulse response prior
            to mixture at the microphone. It should return an array of shape
            ``(n_mics, n_samples)`` containing the mixed microphone signals.
            If such a function is provided, the ``snr`` option is ignored
            and :py:attr:`pyroomacoustics.room.Room.sigma2_awgn` is set to ``None``.
        callback_mix_kwargs: dict, optional
            A dictionary that contains optional arguments for ``callback_mix``
            function
        return_premix: bool, optional
            If set to ``True``, the function will return an array of shape
            ``(n_sources, n_mics, n_samples)`` containing the microphone
            signals with individual sources, convolved with the room impulse
            response but prior to mixing
        recompute_rir: bool, optional
            If set to ``True``, the room impulse responses will be recomputed
            prior to simulation

        Returns
        -------
        Nothing or an array of shape ``(n_sources, n_mics, n_samples)``
