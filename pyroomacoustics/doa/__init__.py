This sub-package provides implementations of popular direction of arrival findings algorithms.

All these classes derive from the abstract base class
:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.doa.doa.DOA` that offers generic methods for finding
and visualizing the locations of acoustic sources.

The constructor can be called once to build the DOA finding object. Then, the
method :py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.doa.doa.DOA.locate_sources` performs DOA
finding based on time-frequency passed to it as an argument. Extra arguments
can be supplied to indicate which frequency bands should be used for
localization.

How to use the DOA module
-------------------------

Here ``R`` is a 2xQ ndarray that contains the locations of the Q microphones
in the columns, ``fs`` is the sampling frequency of the input signal, and
``nfft`` the length of the FFT used.

The STFT snapshots are passed to the localization methods in the X ndarray of
shape ``Q x (nfft // 2 + 1) x n_snapshots``, where ``n_snapshots`` is the
number of STFT frames to use for the localization. The option ``freq_bins``
can be provided to specify which frequency bins to use for the localization.

    >>> doa = pyroomacoustics.doa.MUSIC(R, fs, nfft)
    >>> doa.locate_sources(X, freq_bins=np.arange(20, 40))

Other Available Subpackages
---------------------------

:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.doa.grid`
    this provides abstractions for computing functions on regular or irregular
    grids defined on circles and spheres with peak finding methods

:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.doa.plotters`
    a few methods to plot functions and points on circles or spheres

:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.doa.detect_peaks`
    1D peak detection routine from Marcos Duarte

:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.doa.tools_frid_doa_plane`
    routines implementing FRIDA algorithm

Utilities
---------

:py:obj:`pyroomacoustics.doa.algorithms`
    a dictionary containing all the DOA object subclasses availables indexed by
    keys ``['MUSIC', 'NormMUSIC', 'SRP', 'CSSM', 'WAVES', 'TOPS', 'FRIDA']``

Note on MUSIC
-----------------

Since NormMUSIC has a more robust performance, we recommend to use NormMUSIC over MUSIC. When MUSIC is used as a baseline for publications, we recommend to use both NormMUSIC and MUSIC. For more information, you may have a look at our jupyter notebook at ``https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics/tree/master/notebooks/norm_music_demo.ipynb``
