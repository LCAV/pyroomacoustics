Here we provide a couple tutorials that we hope will help the interested 
reader understand the core functionalities of this package. If you are not opting

[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), as math will be better rendered than on GitHub

* [General pyroomacoustics demo](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LCAV/pyroomacoustics/blob/master/notebooks/pyroomacoustics_demo.ipynb)
* [STFT tutorial and demo](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LCAV/pyroomacoustics/blob/master/notebooks/stft.ipynb)
