Contributing
============
If you want to contribute to `pyroomacoustics` and make it better, your help is
very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about the package itself.

### Ways to contribute

* File bug reports
* Improvements to the documentation are always more than welcome. Keeping a good clean documentation is a challenging task and any help is appreciated.
* Feature requests
* If you implemented an extra DOA/adaptive filter/beamforming algorithm: that's awesome!  We'd love to
  add it to the package.
* Suggestion of improvements to the code base are also welcome.

### Coding style

We try to stick to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as possible.
Variables, functions, modules and packages should be in lowercase with underscores. Class names
in CamelCase.

### Documentation

The docstrings should follow the [numpydoc style](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt).

### Unit Tests

As much as possible, for every new function added to the code base, add a short
test script in `pyroomacoustics/tests`. The names of the script and the
functions running the test should be prefixed by `test_`. The tests are started
by running `nosetests` at the root of the package.

### How to make a clean pull request

Look for a project's contribution instructions. If there are any, follow them.

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- …
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code – not what you did to the code.
