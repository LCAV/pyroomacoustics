TIMIT Corpus
============

Pyroomacoustics includes a wrapper around the popular TIMIT corpus [1]
that can be handy in some situations. Here is a quick rundown of how
to use it.

Since the TIMIT corpus is not open, this example can only be run if
you have access to it. Sorry for that.

To successfully run the example, you will need to set an environment variable
`TIMIT_PATH` to point to the location of your local instance of the TIMIT corpus.
